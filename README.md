# Braintree v.zero Demo using PHP

This is a complete project of a small e-commerce using [Braintree v.zero](https://www.braintreepayments.com/v.zero) and [DropIn](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/js+php/guides/drop-in) for JavaScript client.


It is compatible with [NetBeans](http://www.netbeans.org) and uses [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) to manage v.zero dependencies.
